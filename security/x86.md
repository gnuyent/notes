# Intel x86 Assembly

## Refresher
### Basic decimal/binary/hex conversions

| Decimal | Binary | Hexadecimal |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| 00      | 0000b  | 0x00        |
| 01      | 0001b  | 0x01        |
| 02      | 0010b  | 0x02        |
| 03      | 0011b  | 0x03        |
| 04      | 0100b  | 0x04        |
| 05      | 0101b  | 0x05        |
| 06      | 0110b  | 0x06        |
| 07      | 0111b  | 0x07        |
| 08      | 1000b  | 0x08        |
| 09      | 1001b  | 0x09        |
| 10      | 1010b  | 0x0A        |
| 11      | 1011b  | 0x0B        |
| 12      | 1100b  | 0x0C        |
| 13      | 1101b  | 0x0D        |
| 14      | 1110b  | 0x0E        |
| 15      | 1111b  | 0x0F        |

### Negative numbers in binary
**One's complement** - flip all bits

**Two's complement** - one's complement + 1

Negative numbers are two's complement of positive numbers.

## Architecture

Intel x86 is a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC). It contains a lot of
different special purpose instructions, many which are not commonly used.
Instructions are typically between 1 and 16 bytes.

Other common architectures include Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC).
These typically include more registers and less/fixed-size instructions.
