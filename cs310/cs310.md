# CS 310 - Data Structures

Taught by Professor Shawn Healey, virtually, during Fall 2020 at San Diego State University.

This course utilizes an object oriented programming language, either Java or C++. I will be using C++, neovim (coc+ccls), and gdb in this course.

# 8 Complexity

$\theta$ notation (theta) - how big a function grows.

$\theta(1)$ is the constant time function.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // implementation elided
}
```

Within the `for` loop, all of the instructions are run in constant time. Notice that the comparison and increment operations run 100 times.
